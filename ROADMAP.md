# Roadmap

The purpose of this library is to create a full featured UI framework that can be used for rapid prototyping and development.  It will have a wide variety of features that allow developers to create and manipulate UI elements programmatically and build HTML from XML files (a la Joomla).  Next steps are:

- [] Generate HTML elements
- [] Helper methods to generate whole sections of data programmatically (i.e. data tables, dynamic lists - called "Regions")
- [] XML translation that allows developers to create (data tables, dynamic lists, etc) quickly and easily
